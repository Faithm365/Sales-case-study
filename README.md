- # Key Findings
Sales declined steadily from 2014 to 2016. Similarly the quantities sold also declined which could be to a
-shrinking demand or reduced operations.
-All the years show negative profit margins with 2015 being the worst at (-6.34%)
-The discount periods were identified as the periods when high quantities were sold.
-All the discount dates identified, 
showed losses suggesting that discounts were too aggressive or costs were not controlled.
# Recommendations:
Review pricing strategy and cost structure
Optimize production cost
Analyse customer behaviour
Negotiate better discount terms rather than applying blanket discounts
Control discount prices so that prices are not pushed below cost.
